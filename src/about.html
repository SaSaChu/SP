							<p class="type16_dG mT25 text_left">
								With years of experience in CCTV industry, SpotCam team members once developed WiFi DVR and NAS type NVR for home and small business surveillance in the past in different companies, but soon realized the right solution for this market will have to shatter the traditional idea about CCTV products. With the development of several complementary technologies and popularity of mobile device, it became clear later that cloud based system combine with mobile device viewing will be the best and most friendly solution for home and small business.
							</p>
							<p class="type16_dG mT25 text_left">
								Keep this in mind; SpotCam team was then formed by experts in video streaming, cloud server storage, and web apps in early 2013. It is never easy to build something different, even with the experience and expertise that SpotCam team members possess. Finally, after 12 months’ development and testing, first SpotCam was launched in late 2013 with a design that has never been seen in the past on the market. With SpotCam’s innovative camera design and easy to use interface, our channel partners soon see the potential of our solution and decide to distribute SpotCam in different countries, together with the help of on-line shopping, SpotCam products are now available in a dozen of countries include US, UK, Japan, Germany, and France.
